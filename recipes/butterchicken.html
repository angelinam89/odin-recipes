            <li>5 cloves Garlic (about 5 tsp, minced or crushed)</li>
            <li>2 inch (5cm) Fresh Ginger Root (grated, about 2 tbsp)</li>
            <li>2 tsp Garam Masala</li>
            <li>1 tsp Ground Cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp Smoked Paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp Ground Tumeric</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Chili Powder (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tsp of Salt (add more if needed)</li>
            <li>2 lbs (900g) Chicken Thighs (skinless, boneless, diced into bite-size pieces)</li>
            <li>17 oz (500g) Tomato Sauce (or Passata)</li>
            <li>1 cup (250ml Heavy Whipping Cream (or Coconut Milk, or Half and Half)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Fresh Parsley, Mint, or Cilantro (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>On the Instant Pot press on SAUTE and melt the butter. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook until fragrant (about 1 minute).</li>
            <li>Add all of the spices, and the salt, stir, and cook for a minute. You might want to deglaze the pot at this point if the mixture is stuck to the bottom of the pot, just add a splash of water and scrape off any stuck bits with a wooden spoon. Then add the tomato sauce (passata) and a Â¼ cup of water. Switch off the saute setting.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken thighs, give everything a mix.</li>
            <li>Secure the lid and set the vent to SEALING. Select the PRESSURE COOK/MANUAL setting and set the cooking time for 6 minutes at high pressure. The Instant Pot will take around 10 minutes to come to pressure and start cooking. When the cooking program ends, quickly release the steam.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the lid, and press on SAUTE. Stir in the cream, and allow the sauce to reduce a little (season with more salt if necessary). Taste the sauce and see if you need to add a little bit more salt. Serve warm over rice with chopped parsley or cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
